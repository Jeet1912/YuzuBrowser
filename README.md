## AppyHigh Task Phase
    Objective - Add a deeplinking feature.
    Outcome   - No significant progress.
## Approach 
    * Using Flutter - Created a module for flutter but couldn't integrate it with the native app.
    * Using branch.io - The api wasn't compatible. CustomApplicationClass.java as mentioned in their docs generated unresolvable errors.
                        https://help.branch.io/developers-hub/docs/android-basic-integration
    * Using Firestore - The firestore sdk was integrated successfully but the app crashed when tested.
 ## To conclude
    Debug apk submitted w.r.t commit 769bdb1.
